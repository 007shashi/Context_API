## Newton School Assignment-Text

## 1. Understand the Original Code:
Familiarize with the original app inside the Context-API folder. This app uses the React Context API to manage state and includes Cypress test cases.

## 2. Identify Modifications:
Open the boilerplate folder and carefully review the code.
Identify and locate the intentional modifications made to the code. These modifications specifically involve parts related to the React Context API.

## 3. Document Changes:
Document the changes you identify in the code. Note which components or sections related to the Context API have been altered or removed.

## 4. Understand the Impact:
Consider how the intentional modifications might affect the functionality of the app.
Analyze how these changes would impact the previously written Cypress test cases.

## 5. Run Cypress Tests:
Use the Cypress testing framework to run the test cases on the modified code.
Observe the test results and note any failures caused by the intentional modifications.

## 6. Reflect and Comment:
Write a brief reflection on the impact of the identified modifications.
Include comments on how the intentional changes affected the functionality and testability of the app.

This part of the assignment assesses our ability to identify intentional modifications to code and understand the impact on functionality and testing.
